            <h2>1. Scope</h2>
            <p>This cookie policy applies in addition to the general privacy policy for our website and provides extra
                information about the type, scope and purpose of data processing for cookies and cookie-like
                technologies
                (hereinafter, for the sake of simplicity, also referred to as "cookies"). We would like to point out
                that
                this
                cookie policy does not apply to all websites concerning Porsche. In particular, websites of other
                Porsche
                companies or for other international markets and websites of Porsche centers or Porsche dealers and
                service
                companies have their own setting options and may have different policies.</p>

            <h2>3. Categories of personal data</h2>
            <p>When we refer to the categories of data processed in this Porsche Cookie Policy, we mean in particular
                the
                following data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Master data (e.g. names, addresses, dates of birth)</li>
                <li>Contact data (e.g. e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, messenger services)</li>
                <li>Content data (e.g. text entered, photos, videos, contents of documents/files)</li>
                <li>Contractual data (e.g. object of the contract, terms, customer categories)</li>
                <li>Payment data (e.g. bank details, payment history, use of other payment service providers)</li>
                <li>Usage data (e.g. history on our website, use of specific content, access times, contact or order
                    history)
                </li>
                <li>Connection data (e.g. device information, IP addresses, URL referrer)</li>
                <li>Location data (e.g. GPS data, IP geo-localisation, access points)</li>
                <li>Diagnostic data (e.g. crash logs, performance data of the website/app, other technical data for the
                    analysis
                    of faults and errors)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Categories of cookies and similar technologies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are text files that are stored or read by a website on your end device. They contain combinations
                of
                letters and numbers which enable us to recognise the user and user settings when the user returns to the
                website
                which set the cookie; they also enable the user to stay logged in to a customer account and allow us to
                statistically analyse a certain user behaviour.</p>
            <p>The WebStorage technology enables the local storage of variables and values in the user's browser cache.
                The
                technology includes so-called 'sessionStorage' which remains stored until the browser tab is closed as
                well
                as
                'localStorage' which remains stored in the browser cache until the cache is emptied by the user. The
                localStorage technology enables, among other things, recognition of the user and user settings when the
                user
                comes back to our website.</p>
            <p>Cookies/similar technologies can only be accessed from the Internet address where the cookie was set.
                This
                means
                that we cannot access the cookies set by the service providers involved. They cannot access our cookies
                either.
                Third parties cannot access our cookies or those of the involved service providers. Third parties may
                only
                gain
                access by technical attacks which we cannot control and for which we are not responsible.</p>
            <p>Pixel tags are small graphic files which are loaded from the servers of the respective service provider
                when
                a
                user accesses our website. This also includes loading of the program code which enables the collection
                of
                data
                (e.g. regarding your user behaviour while visiting our website).</p>

            <h3>Cookies and similar technologies can enable information to be stored in your terminal device or
                information
                stored in your terminal device to be accessed. The cookies used on our websites can be divided into
                different
                categories.</h3>

            <p>While technically necessary cookies are always stored when you visit our websites, you have the option of
                specifying whether or not you want to allow the use of cookies in the other categories. You can change
                your
                settings at any time. Please note that blocking certain types of cookies may result in an impaired
                experience of
                our website and/or the services and functions that can be accessed via it. For general information on
                the
                cookies used, please refer to the sections and detailed views below ('Your Cookie Settings').</p>

            <h2>5. Location of Processing</h2>
            <p>The processing of personal data collected by means of cookies is generally carried out in the European
                Union
                (EU)
                and the European Economic Area (EEA) or in third countries for which the European Commission has
                confirmed
                an
                adequate level of data protection in accordance with Article 45 (3) GDPR. However, in particular the
                third-party
                providers used may have their registered office in third countries such as the United States of America
                (USA),
                which do not have a level of data protection corresponding to that under the GDPR, or process the data
                there. In
                such cases, we observe the requirements of Articles 44 et seq. GDPR and, where possible, take measures
                to
                bring
                the level of data protection in line with the standard of the GDPR by means of appropriate guarantees,
                in
                particular by concluding standard data protection clauses/standard contractual clauses as issued by the
                European
                Commission pursuant to Article 46 (2) (c) GDPR. In this respect, a transfer may also take place if this
                is
                necessary for the performance of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures pursuant
                to
                Article 49 (1) (b) and (c) GDPR.</p>
            <p>As far as cookies for analysis as well as for (potentially personalized) marketing are concerned, which
                are
                only
                used on the basis of consent, the corresponding declaration of consent pursuant to Article 49 (1) (a)
                GDPR
                also
                includes the fact that the data may be processed in third countries outside the EU, which do not have a
                level of
                data protection that complies with the GDPR. For more information on the location of processing for the
                cookies
                used, please refer to the sections and detailed views below ("Your Cookie Settings"). Please note in
                connection
                with giving consent that due to the different legal situation in the third countries, there may be
                latent
                risks
                that transferred data may not be processed in accordance with the GDPR (e.g., by the third party
                providers
                merging the data with other data and using it for their own purposes, and you may not be able to
                exercise
                data
                subject rights such as rights to access and deletion against it as would be possible under the GDPR). In
                particular, local authorities in the respective third country could gain access to the data without
                providing
                you with effective legal protection or enforceable rights as in the EU.</p>

            <h2>6. Consent and options for objecting to the use of cookies and similar technologies</h2>
            <p>In the settings for cookies and similar technologies on our website, you have the option to voluntarily
                consent
                to the use of technologies for analysis as well as for (potentially personalized) marketing and the
                potentially
                corresponding transfer of data to third countries individually or in general and revoke them at any time
                for
                the
                future.</p>
            <p>If you do not wish to use certain technologies or cookies in general, you can also prevent them from
                being
                stored
                on your end device by setting the appropriate settings on your end device and/or internet browser. You
                can
                select 'Do not accept cookies' in your Internet browser settings. The process for managing and deleting
                cookies
                in your Internet browser settings is detailed in the help menu of your Internet browser. You can also
                block
                all
                cookies using free Internet browser add-ons such as 'Adblock Plus' (adblockplus.org/de/) in combination
                with
                the
                'EasyPrivacy' list (easylist.to) or 'Ghostery' (ghostery.com). Access to similar technologies such as
                WebStorage
                content or pixel tags cannot be excluded in every case.</p>
            <p>Stored cookies can be deleted at any time in the system settings of your device and/or Internet browser.
            </p>
            <p>Please note that the functionality and range of functions of our offer may be limited if you block
                cookies or
                similar technologies or do not give your consent to their use.</p>

                    * All new vehicles offered by Porsche are type-approved according to
                    WLTP. Official NEDC values derived from WLTP values are no longer
                    available for new vehicles as of 1 January 2023 and can therefore
                    not be provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where values are indicated as ranges, they do not refer to a single,
                    specific vehicle and are not part of the offered product range. They
                    are only for the purposes of comparison between different vehicle
                    types. Additional equipment and accessories (add-on parts, tyre
                    formats etc.) can change relevant vehicle parameters such as weight,
                    rolling resistance and aerodynamics. These factors, in addition to
                    weather, traffic conditions and driving behaviour, can influence the
                    fuel/electricity consumption, CO₂ emissions, range and performance
                    values of a vehicle.
