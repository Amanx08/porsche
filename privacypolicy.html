            <h2>2. Subject of data protection</h2>
            <p>The subject of data protection is the protection of personal data. This is all information relating to an
                identified or identifiable natural person (so-called data subject). This includes information such as
                name,
                postal address, email address or telephone number, but also other information that may be generated when
                using
                the Online Service, in particular information about the beginning, end and extent of use as well as the
                transmission of your IP address.</p>

            <h2>3. Purposes and legal basis of data processing</h2>
            <p>In the following, you will find an overview of the purposes and legal basis of data processing in
                connection
                with
                the Online Service. In any case, we process personal data in accordance with the legal requirements,
                even if
                in
                individual cases a different legal basis should be relevant than that stated below.</p>

            <p>The provision of personal data by you may be required by law or contract or may be necessary for the
                conclusion
                of a contract. We will point it out separately if you are obliged to provide personal data and what
                possible
                consequences the non-supply would then have (e.g. a loss of claims or our position not to provide the
                requested
                service without providing certain information). The use of the Online Service is generally possible
                without
                registration. The use of individual functions may require prior registration. Even if you use the Online
                Service
                without registration, personal data may still be processed.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Performance of a contract and pre-contractual measures</h3>
            <p>We process your personal data if this is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a
                party
                or
                for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to your request. The data
                processing is
                based on Article 6 paragraph 1 letter b) GDPR. The purposes of processing include enabling the use of
                our
                specific products and services within the scope of the Online Service. Please also note the details in
                the
                respective documents describing our products and services further to this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>In particular, these are the following functions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Registration process and creation of a user profile</strong><br>

                    Agent), Web-shop and Webspecials.</li>

                <li><strong>Magazine orders and subscriptions</strong><br>

                <li><strong>Live chat</strong><br>
                    In certain areas of the Online Service, we offer contact and advice via live chat. With the help of
                    the
                    live
                    chat, you can communicate with one of our consultants via text messages.</li>

            <h3>3.2 Compliance with legal obligations</h3>
            <p>We process your personal data to comply with legal obligations to which we are subject. The data
                processing
                is
                based on Article 6 paragraph 1 letter c) GDPR. These obligations may arise, for example, from
                commercial,
                tax,
                money laundering, financial or criminal law. The purposes of the processing result from the respective
                legal
                obligation; as a rule, the processing serves the purpose of complying with state control and information
                obligations.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Safeguarding of legitimate interests</h3>
            <p>We also process your personal data to pursue the legitimate interests of ourselves or third parties,
                unless
                your
                rights, which require the protection of your personal data, outweigh these interests. The data
                processing is
                based on Article 6 paragraph 1 letter f) GDPR.</p>

            <h4>3.3.1 Retrieval of the online offer</h4>
            <p>When you call up the Online Service, data relating to your end device and your use of the online offer
                are
                processed and stored in a so-called log file.</p>

            <h4>3.3.2 Studies and surveys</h4>
            <p>As part of the further development of products, services and support offers, you may be selected from
                time to
                time to participate in a study or survey when visiting our Online Service.</p>

            <h3>3.4 Consent</h3>
            <p>We process your personal data on the basis of corresponding consent. The data processing is based on

            <h3>3.5 Change of purpose</h3>
            <p>If we process your personal data for a purpose other than that for which the data was collected, beyond
                the
                scope
                of a corresponding consent or a mandatory legal basis, we will take into account, in accordance with
                Article
                6
                paragraph 4 GDPR, the compatibility of the original and the now pursued purpose, the nature of the
                personal
                data, the possible consequences of further processing for you and the guarantees for the protection of
                the
                personal data.</p>

            <h3>3.6 Profiling</h3>
            <p>We do not carry out automated decision making or profiling in accordance with Article 22 GDPR. Profiling
                is
                only
                carried out to protect our legitimate interests as described above.</p>

            <h2>4. Access authorizations in the end device</h2>
            <p>To the extent functions of the Online Service require the granting of authorization to access your end
                device
                (e.g. access to location data or photos), the granting of these authorizations is voluntary.</p>

            <h2>5. Cookies and comparable technologies</h2>
            <p>We use cookies and comparable technologies in connection with the Online Service which serve to
                communicate
                with

                    * All new vehicles offered by Porsche are type-approved according to
                    WLTP. Official NEDC values derived from WLTP values are no longer
                    available for new vehicles as of 1 January 2023 and can therefore
                    not be provided.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where values are indicated as ranges, they do not refer to a single,
                    specific vehicle and are not part of the offered product range. They
                    are only for the purposes of comparison between different vehicle
                    types. Additional equipment and accessories (add-on parts, tyre
                    formats etc.) can change relevant vehicle parameters such as weight,
                    rolling resistance and aerodynamics. These factors, in addition to
                    weather, traffic conditions and driving behaviour, can influence the
                    fuel/electricity consumption, CO₂ emissions, range and performance
                    values of a vehicle.
